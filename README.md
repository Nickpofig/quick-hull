# quick-hull
WIP. A program that finds a sequence of points, which represents a "convex hull" for a given set of points, implemented using a parallelized "Quick-Hull" algorithm.

# Compilation 
To compile program you firstly need to compile system-run. 
For example, on Windows platform using clang compiler frontend:
```
	clang ./dependencies/system-run/main.c -o run.exe
```
Then run:
```
	./run program.COMPILER.build
```
